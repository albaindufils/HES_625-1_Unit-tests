With Image Edge Detection you can upload a .png, .jpg, .bpm image and apply different filters.

At the start a picture is proposed at the user but, of course, the user can choose this own picture with the "load" button.

After one image is loaded (so, in this case, immediatly) a combobox appear and we decide to leave the choice at the user to change the filter (to choose the best for him). 
A preview picture can be watch in a new screen (on the right) immediatly after the user have selected the filter.
In this state the user can apply any filter one after one and see the result each time.

Once selecting the first filter tools for edge detection appear.
After the user has been choosed the appropriate filter, he could select the Edge filters about the X and Y coordonate.
After that, when he has been validated his choise with the button "Apply filter", the combox of filters disapears immediatly to prevent changing the filters.

The user has the possibility to save the modified image and he can begin again with another picture when he want during its use.
